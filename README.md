# flimey core

![Scala CI](https://github.com/flimeyio/flimey-core/workflows/Scala%20CI/badge.svg)

**A self hosted business and productivity board tool with organization management and runtime enabled structural modeling.**

## Release Notes

*This project is work in progress. We still need some time to implement major features bevore going in a production release cycle. As of now, the latest somewhat stable beta versions are puplished occasionally via the ``release/latest`` branch. This will always create a new ``latest`` release in our dockerhub repository [flimeylab](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/flimeylab/flimey-core). DO ABSOLUTELY NOT USE THOSE BUILDS IN PRODUCTION, THEY ARE JUST MEANT FOR TESTING.*

**To install the container the first time, execute the following two lines. The http site will be available at port 9080. See our wiki (link below) for first usage instructions.**

```
docker volume create flimeydata
docker run -it --name=flimey --mount source=flimeydata,destination=/var/lib/postgresql -p 9080:9080 -p 9443:9443 flimey-cored
```

> :zap: The container can be created without mounting a volume. By doing so THE CONTAINER CAN NOT BE UPDATED IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT DATA LOSS!

> âš¡ A once created flimeydata volume can be mounted to newer container versions (after an update).
However, do not mount the same volume to two running containers at once! Right now, we do not guarantee data compatability with newer versions.

> ðŸš‘ Right now, the flimey docker image works only as long as postgresql v12 is the newest major version. This needs to be fixed in the
run.sh file.

**To stop the running container, execute**
(To avoid the possibility of incomplete workflows, it is recommended to cut the network connection
some seconds before, if multiple users are active during the shutdown. However, the db will always stay valid)

``docker stop flimey``


**To start the container which was already installed, execute**

``docker start flimey``
